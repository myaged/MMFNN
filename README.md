# MMFNN
Guiding source code for the MMFNN algorithm described in 
Yagci et al., "A Meta-algorithm for Improving Top-N Prediction Efficiency of Matrix Factorization Models in Collaborative Filtering".

*mf* and *predict* directories within *src* directory contain the building blocks of the algorithm. They also contain examples based on a small dataset provided in the *data* directory for an initial experience with input/output and parameterization. 

For compilation instructions see the main files in *mf* and *predict* directories within *src* directory.
